> ## ScreenFetch
>
> screenFetch was originally made as a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". Simply, it lets you display detailed information about your system in the terminal, it also comes with a ASCII logo for the detected Linux distribution.
>
> This doesn't work on Windows natively and this project is my attempt to provide a solution that does not require obtaining a linux environment on windows.
>
> The original can be found in [KittyKatt's repository](https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch).
>
> ## How is it different
>
> The original screenfetch requires a system that supports bash so it cannot be used on windows natively! This is a small scale project that simply "mimics" the behaviour of screenFetch in windows.
>
> __Windows screenFetch is a PowerShell script, not a Bash program.__ Therefore, a linux-like environment such as [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys) is ___not required___. This can be run natively on windows as a PowerShell script within a PowerShell or command prompt console.
>
> _Since this tool is only intended to run within a windows environment, no flags to invoke any Linux distribution ASCII art is supported._

## Troubleshooting

If you have followed the installation steps but you're getting the following error:

```PowerShell
The file C:\<yourpath>\screenfetch.ps1 is not digitally signed.
The script will not execute on the system.
```

A common fix is to run the PowerShell command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` in a shell with administrative privileges.
